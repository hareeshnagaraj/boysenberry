So, why make a chrome extension? Basically, sometimes you don't want to open dev tools to check out the CSS and layout of a page.

The goal of this extension is to make finding basic CSS much easier than right clicking and painstakingly finding the right information.

Upon activation the following is provided to the user:
Outlines of all the elements on a page (similar to android developer tools' layout bounds)
CSS upon hover of any element
Mouse action summary (x,y position on page, etc)
